## 🧠 What Is a Wallhack in XDefiant?

A **wallhack**, also called **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)**, overlays visual data on your screen that the game normally hides. That means:

* 🔴 You’ll **see enemies** through walls
* 💼 Spot **loot, medkits, and ammo** before anyone else
* 📏 Know **exact distances** and positions
* 💀 Pre-aim and pre-fire **with confidence**

This isn’t just about vision — it's about full **map control and anticipation**.
